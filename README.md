# TOE (Totally Over Engineered) config made by tofu


also, HUUUUGEEE credits to mastercom, took a lot of inspiration from there https://mastercomfig.com/app/

## Presets:

	better default:
		almost no visual impact, just nice settings and a bit higher fps than tf2's default settings
		
		deliberately didn't touch graphical settings that can be changed with the in game UI 
		[except stuff like FOV (should always be 90) and vsync (should always be off)], 
		so you don't have to edit the config to change the graphics.

	better default - clarity:
		almost no visual impact, just nice settings and higher fps than tf2's default settings
		
		deliberately didn't touch graphical settings that can be changed with the in game UI 
		[except stuff like FOV (should always be 90) and vsync (should always be off), and motion blur (which should be off for more clarity)], 
		so you don't have to edit the config to change the graphics.
		
		no ragdolls, gibs and small explosion effects for maximum clarity
		removed map background noises
		no bullet hole dust

	the tofu special: 
		pixelated textures, game is undeniably ugly
		
		no ragdolls, gibs and small explosion effects for maximum clarity
		focus on high fps without removing too much (like hats)
		removed map background noises
		no bullet hole dust

## Customization:
	I tried to comment everything as much as possible, its still a lot harder to customize than 
	mastercomfig for example, but i tried to make it as easy as possible.
	
	If you want to overwrite stuff the easiest thing to do is to just put the commands in 'custom.cfg'.
	
	If you want class specific binds: 
		put the bind you want to keep the same for other classes in 'binds.cfg'.
		put the bind you want to overwrite for a specific class in '<class_name>.cfg'.
	
	Same goes for any other settings but you put the other settings in 'general.cfg',
	and the class specific ones in '<class_name>.cfg'. 
	This can be useful if you want to use a different sensitivity on solder for example but want to use the same on every other class.
